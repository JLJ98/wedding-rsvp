This application is an online, paperless experience for the bride and groom to plan their special day a bit easier.

We are coming upon wedding season in the era of eco-friendly and instant information, this application has a stress-free and secure way of storing all your wedding day guests' information and categorizing it instantaneously for the wedding planner.

We wanted the user to be able to create a login, enter their name, add if they have a plus (adding their name if applicable), and check any dietary restriction boxes for the planner to notate.
